
-Make Showcase app available live (on AppEngine)

-Additional "internal" events:
	-tab changed (selected) use ETYPE_CHANGE
	-expander changed (expanded, collapsed) ETYPE_CHANGE
	-link activated (maybe this is already covered with ETYPE_ONCLICK? check it!)
	-image loaded/failed

-Refactor: TabBarPlacement => SidePlacement (same constants: TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT)?

-ImageButton or SetImage() method for Button

-Add possibility to serve static content, so users can register a folder to
	server their images, custom css and js. 

-Implement Comp.RemoveEHandler() and Comp.RemoveEHandlerFunc() (and use it when removing Tabs...)

-New components:
	-new comps for input type (problem: weak support, mostly just by Chrome and Opera): date; color; range (jslider) 
	-SuggestBox
	-Absolute Panel
	-Slider
	-iframe, in the showcase app it should link/contain the source code of the showcase app! 
	-ProgressBar
	-Form (+ fileuploader, submit button)
	-Audio and Video (HTML5)
	-YouTube


-On client side display a progress icon while waiting for events or refreshing comps.
Also display an error icon if an ajax call fails, gather messages and list them all when clicked.


-Rewrite window list to use gwu components (be a real Window); also allow replacing it (at Server)
	-Consider a Home Window (also replacable)


-Ability to "push" from server to client (not just when an event is received).
	-websocket?
	-Timer component which periodically sends an event?

-Somehow save window state and reload. (serialization)

-LIMITATIONS @ doc.go

-More return actions for events: "redirect to a URL (e.g. another window)", "show an alert or confirm. dialog"
