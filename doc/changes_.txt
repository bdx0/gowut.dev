
Changes and new features in 0.8.0:
----------------------------------

-Significant event system improvements.
* Event types are now categorized. This category can be accessed with EventType.Category(). Events that existed before fall under the ECAT_GENERAL category.
* 2 new event types in the ECAT_WINDOW category: ETYPE_WIN_LOAD and ETYPE_WIN_UNLOAD. These can be used to detect the window load and unload events. They are to be used for Window only.
* A new event type in the ECAT_INTERNAL category: ETYPE_STATE_CHANGE. This is an internal event type which is related to state changes in component internals such as changing selected tab (TabPanel) or expanding/collapsing an Expander. 
  These internal events usually have a parent event designating the source sub-component (such as a tab or the header of an expander) and the mouse coordinates for example.

-Event sending from clients are now asynchronous (instead of synchronous). The GUI Server implements proper RW locking.
Component re-rendering is still synchronous (to avoid browser specific DOM rendering errors).

-Set a max age for the gwu session id cookie.

-More optimization.
